# odin-recipes

# this is the first project from odin
# only using HTMl, so do not expect of something fancy here
# because it's a very basic websites project.

# BY THE END THIS PROJECT, I should know:
#   1. Knowing the HTML tags and elements and how they works.
#   2. Know how to write boilerplate so web browser can recognize it.
#   3. Know how to create multiple pages
#   4. Know how to change font style (is not necessary, but I don't like serif fonts, not hate it but don't like it, you know what I mean?)
